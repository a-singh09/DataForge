## ÔøΩ Problem Statement

### Current AI Industry Challenges

**For AI Companies & Researchers:**

- **Licensing Uncertainty**: Most datasets on platforms like Kaggle lack clear commercial licensing terms
- **Legal Risk**: Using "free" datasets without proper licensing can lead to costly legal disputes
- **Quality Issues**: No standardized quality metrics or creator accountability
- **Attribution Problems**: Difficulty tracking data provenance and giving proper credit

**For Data Creators:**

- **No Monetization**: Valuable training data shared freely with no compensation
- **Lack of Control**: Once uploaded, creators lose control over how their data is used
- **No Recognition**: Creators rarely receive attribution for their contributions to AI breakthroughs

### How DataForge Solves These Problems

DataForge addresses these critical issues through blockchain-verified licensing and decentralized ownership:

- **Clear Licensing**: Every dataset has transparent, legally-binding license terms stored on-chain
- **Creator Compensation**: Automated royalty distribution ensures creators are fairly compensated
- **Usage Tracking**: Blockchain records provide complete audit trails for compliance
- **Quality Assurance**: Community-driven ratings and verification systems

## üîß Origin SDK Integration

DataForge leverages the Origin SDK for comprehensive blockchain functionality:

### 1. Authentication & Wallet Integration

```typescript
import { CampProvider, useAuth, useAuthState } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

// Wrap app with Origin provider
<CampProvider clientId="your-client-id">
  <App />
</CampProvider>

// Use authentication hooks
const auth = useAuth();
const { authenticated } = useAuthState();
```

### 2. File Upload & IpNFT Minting

```typescript
// Direct file minting with licensing terms
const tokenId = await auth.origin.mintFile(
  file, // File object
  {
    name: "Dataset Name",
    description: "Dataset description",
    category: "computer-vision",
  },
  {
    price: BigInt("1000000000000000000"), // 1 ETH in wei
    duration: 86400, // 1 day in seconds
    royaltyBps: 500, // 5% royalty
    paymentToken: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // ETH
  },
);
```

### 3. Marketplace Operations

```typescript
// Check user access to datasets
const hasAccess = await auth.origin.hasAccess(tokenId, userAddress);

// Purchase dataset access with automatic payment handling
const result = await auth.origin.buyAccessSmart(tokenId, periods);

// Download dataset content (only if user has access)
const data = await auth.origin.getData(tokenId);
```

### 4. License Management

```typescript
// Get license terms for any dataset
const terms = await auth.origin.getTerms(tokenId);

// Check subscription expiry
const expiry = await auth.origin.subscriptionExpiry(tokenId, userAddress);

// Renew existing access
const renewal = await auth.origin.renewAccess(tokenId, periods);
```

### 5. Content & Ownership Verification

```typescript
// Verify ownership and metadata
const owner = await auth.origin.ownerOf(tokenId);
const contentHash = await auth.origin.contentHash(tokenId);
const tokenURI = await auth.origin.tokenURI(tokenId);

// Update license terms (owner only)
await auth.origin.updateTerms(tokenId, newLicenseTerms);
```
